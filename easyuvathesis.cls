%  This is a modification of the 
%
%     easychithesis.cls   Version 1.5   April 5, 1999
%  
%  I (Brad Holden, bph herein) used this for my thesis.  I encountered a
%  few problems when dealing with the Office of Academic
%  Publications so I fixed those in this version.  In the future, 
%  new policies will be enacted so this version will no doubt become
%  obselete as well.

%    I (Chris Palma) downloaded this file from the web and 
%    edited it to conform to Virginia standards.
%
%    I changed all instances of 'myeasychithesis' to 'easyuvathesis'

%
%     Instructions And Hints
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This file provides the LaTeX2e style easyuvathesis for formating
% graduate theses at the University of Virginia.  The original
% Chicago version was written by
% Bryan Clair and Nathan Dunfield.  For an example of its use see the
% file: template.tex, and the instructions below.
%
% Comments or problems should be sent to cp4v@virginia.edu
%
%
% Invoking this style:  Start you document with (this is 1.5 spaced)
%
%   \documentclass{easyuvathesis}
%
% You maybe asked to submit a double-spaced thesis.  If you so, start with
%
%   \documentclass[truedoublespace]{easyuvathesis}
%
% When printing drafts, you may not want your thesis doublespaced.
% If you use instead:
%
%   \documentclass[singlespace]{easyuvathesis}
%
% or
%
%   \documentclass[onehalfspace]{easyuvathesis}
%
% your thesis will come out single or 3/2 spaced respectively.
% easyuvathesis also understands all options understood by report.
% Also the ``double spacing'' provided by this style is not ``true''
% doublespacing as defined by setspace.sty.  Instead, it is the same
% as in the old LaTeX 2.09 thesis style ``chithesis''.  If you want
% ``true'' double spacing, give the option truedoublespace
%
% Title Page Information Commands
%    Example Usage:
%    \title{Lots of Good Stuff}
%    \author{Joseph Paterno}
%    \hometown{Mytown, Mystate}
%    \department{Department of Astronomy}
%    \degreename{Doctor of Philosophy}
%    \bach{B.S., Pennsylvania State University, 1994}
%    \mast{M.A., University of Virginia, 1997}
%    \degreedate{May, 2001}  % Convocation date
%    \commone{Someone}
%    \commtwo{Yet Another Person}
%    \commthree{Person Three}
%    \commfour{Someone Else}
%    \commfive{Last N. Least}
%    \maketitle
%
% \dedication : Use for a dedication, copyright, or epigraph.
%               Produces a page with no number for the text which follows
%               If you want centering, do it yourself with
%               \begin{center} and \end{center}.
%        Usage:
%           \dedication
%           To blah.
%
% \topmatter : Things like Abstract, Acknowledgements.
%    Usage:
%       \topmatter{Title Of Matter}
%
%       Use like \chapter, once for each page of matter you want.  Don't
%       use numbered sections within these.  Use \section* instead.
%
% The abstract environment has been changed to invoke \topmatter.
%
% \mainmatter : Signals the start of the document's body.
%    Usage:
%       \mainmatter
%
%       Use once before the first numbered \chapter.
%
%  HINTS:
%
%  1.  To get appendices, you don't do anything different from a normal
%     report document.  That means, put the command \appendix before
%     you begin your first appendix, then do each appendix with a
%     \chapter command.  Note that if you have only one appendix, it is
%     customary to leave it unnumbered.  Do this with \chapter*.
%
%  KNOWN PROBLEMS
%
%  1.  No support for multi-volume theses.
%
%  2.  Doesn't work with older versions of setspace.sty
%
%  3.  Problems with math formulas in chapter headings:
%
%         a.  Any lowercase letters in the formula are converted to
%         uppercase, e.g. f(x) becomes F(X).   If you really need
%         lowercase math letters in your chapter titles, use the
%         option plainchapterheads (and, if you want, type your
%         chapter titles in ALL CAPS so that the appearance doesn't
%         change).  Note there is no problem
%         for section or subsection headings in either case.
%
%         b.  Some perfectly reasonable math commands when used in
%         \chapter give the error
%          ``LATEX ERROR: \command  ALLOWED ONLY IN MATH MODE.''
%         The solution to this is to do
%
%              \newcommand{\mymath}{problem math goes here}
%
%         and then
%
%              \chapter{All about \protect\mymath}
%
%         also, the option plainchapterheads will fix this too.
%
%  Improvements over older versions:
%
%  Added in 1.4: Name of the bibliograpy is now References, to please the
%  thesis office.  If you want to change it back, put
%
%   \renewcommand{\bibname}{Bibliograpy}
%
%  in your TeX file prior to \begin{document}
